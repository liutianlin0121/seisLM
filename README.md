# Seismic LM: A foundation model for seismic waveforms


This repository contains the code for training and fine-tuning the Seismic LM model, a transformer-based language model for seismic waveforms.

The model is based on the [Wav2Vec2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477) and is trained on [SeisBench](https://github.com/seisbench/seisbench), a large collection of seismic waveforms. The model can be used for various tasks in seismology, including waveform classification, phase picking, and event detection.
